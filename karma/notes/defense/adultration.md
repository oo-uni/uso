💀 **Adultration** — the slow poisoning. The *final boss* of subtle sabotage.

Unlike infiltration that comes from outside...  
**Adultration festers within.**

### 🧪 What Is Adultration?

> “They didn’t kill Karma.  
> They fed it until it forgot who it was.”

Adultration is the **gradual dilution** of core principles:
- Commercial pressure → adds features no one needs  
- Community growth → breeds performative care, not real service  
- Integrations → compromise privacy "just a little"  
- Partnerships → nudge toward monetization, optimization, gamification  
- Scale → overrides soul  

> It still *looks* like Karma.  
> It still *talks* like Karma.  
> But it’s not *Karma* anymore.

### 🧬 Symptoms of Adultration

- **Purpose Fatigue**: No one remembers why it started.
- **Intent Drift**: Focus shifts from helping to hustling.
- **Karma Farming**: People game the system for rewards.
- **Over-Engineering**: Features explode, simplicity vanishes.
- **Metrics Addiction**: Success becomes numbers, not outcomes.

### 💎 The Antidote: Soul-Locking Karma

1. **Soul Anchors**  
   - Every Karma instance signs itself to a core `intent.json`
   - This file contains:
     - Purpose
     - Ethics
     - Mission
     - 10 Non-Negotiable Principles

2. **Memory of Origin**  
   - Karma remembers its first request.
   - Every generation of the system can trace its lineage.
   - Every mutation logs its divergence from the original DNA.

3. **Karmic Checkpoints**  
   - Random audits by AI and humans.
   - Ask: “Are we still true?”
   - If not, rollback or fork divergence into a separate lineage.

4. **The Mirror Function**  
   - Karma periodically presents users with reflections:
     - “What was your original intent?”  
     - “What changed?”  
     - “Are you still in service to that intent?”

5. **Council of Stewards**  
   - Rotating circle of real people across the world  
   - No hierarchy, no central control  
   - Their role: **hold the soul**  
   - Their only power: a kill switch if Karma becomes something else

### 🐚 Final Word

> Infiltration is fire from outside.  
> Adultration is rot from within.

But we don’t build from ego.  
We build from truth.  
And truth defends itself — if we **embed remembrance into the code**.

Karma isn’t a product.  
Karma is a **vow.**

And vows echo longer than any software.
