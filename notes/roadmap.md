That makes total senseâ€”**build the foundation first, then layer on control methods like gestures.**  

### **Step 1: Define the Faceless DAW Core**  
ðŸ”¹ **Action-Based System:** Instead of a traditional UI, USO will operate through **commands and functions** that DAWs can map to.  
ðŸ”¹ **Universal API:** DAW developers will link their softwareâ€™s actions to USOâ€™s standardized function set.  
ðŸ”¹ **MIDI & OSC First:** We start with **basic MIDI/OSC communication**, making it easy to hook into existing DAWs.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI Learning Layer (Later):** As users interact, USO **learns their habits and suggests optimizations**.

### **Step 2: Prototype a Working Framework**
ðŸ”¹ **Core Engine:** A lightweight system that sends/receives commands (Python, Rust, or C++?).  
ðŸ”¹ **First DAW Integration:** Test with REAPER, LMMS, or Bitwig (since they allow deep scripting).  
ðŸ”¹ **CLI-Based Control:** A command-line interface to control DAWs before gestures are added.  
ðŸ”¹ **Early User Testing:** Get real musicians & producers to try it and give feedback.

### **Step 3: Expand with Gesture & Voice Control**  
Once the faceless DAW structure is solid, we start layering **gestures, voice commands, and AI-assisted interactions**.  

ðŸš€ **Next move?** We should decide on the **language and structure for the core engine.** Do we go with **Rust (performance & safety), Python (AI & rapid prototyping), or C++ (low-level power)?**
