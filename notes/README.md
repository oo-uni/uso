Universal Sensory Organism


Exactly! If we architect it right, this won't just be for DAWs—it could extend into **video editing, game engines, creative software, even robotics**.  

The key is to make the **core framework modular, protocol-agnostic, and adaptable**. Instead of just thinking "DAW," we should define it as:  
✅ **A universal execution layer** that understands actions across multiple domains.  
✅ **An abstraction bridge** that maps user inputs (gestures, voice, MIDI, etc.) to software/hardware functions.  
✅ **A system that learns and optimizes itself** based on real-world use.  

### **Decision Point: Tech Stack**
To make it **deployable across platforms**, we should consider:  
- **Rust** (performance, security, cross-platform)  
- **WebAssembly (WASM)** (runs in browsers, lightweight execution)  
- **Python** (AI/machine learning, fast prototyping)  
- **C++** (low-level power, deep system integration)  

Rust + WASM might be the most **future-proof** choice. Thoughts?
