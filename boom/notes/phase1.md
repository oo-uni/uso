BOOM. Let’s root this properly. 🌱

We’ll begin with an **open-source AI stack** — lightweight, modular, regenerative — just like the movement it serves. Here's a full **seed-to-stack map**: what we need, where to host, and how to deploy.

---

## 🌍 **PHASE 1: BOOM AI — Open Source Stack to Launch the Movement**

---

## 🧠 CORE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE (BIE)

### 🔹 Functions:
- Climate & soil compatibility (tree ↔ land)
- Regenerative planning & recommendations
- Natural language Q&A for non-technical users
- Karma Credit calculation logic
- Feedback-based learning (from real-world nodes)

### 🔧 Tools / Models:
| Task | Tech/Model | Source |
|------|------------|--------|
| NLP / Q&A | LLaMA 2, Mistral 7B, or Mixtral | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) |
| Ecological matching | Decision trees + lightweight neural nets | Custom-built |
| Image/soil scan | Segment Anything (Meta), FastAI | [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) |
| Feedback learning | RLHF (Reinforcement learning from human feedback) | HuggingFace + Datasets |

> 🔁 These can be containerized with **Docker** and run on edge/local/low-power setups.

---

## 🧱 FRAMEWORKS & INTERFACE

### 🔹 Tools:
- 🌿 Frontend: **SvelteKit** or **Next.js** — fast, minimal, open
- ⚙️ Backend: **FastAPI** (Python) — clean, async-ready
- 🔌 API Layer: **GraphQL** for flexibility (optional)
- 📦 Packaging: **Docker** for portability

> Multilingual interface is a must — integrate **T2T transformers** or translation APIs (LibreTranslate, NLLB)

---

## 📦 STORAGE & DATASETS

### 🔹 Hosting:
| Type | Option | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Open data hosting | **OpenStreetMap, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Planet Labs (free tier), UN FAO datasets** | Initial layers |
| Structured project DB | **Supabase** or **PostgreSQL** | Fast, scalable, open |
| File storage (kits, maps) | **IPFS (decentralized)** or **Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2** | Cost-effective, sustainable |

---

## ☁️ HOSTING & DEPLOYMENT

### 🔹 Stack Locations:
| Need | Platform | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Lightweight AI hosting | **Replicate.com**, **HuggingFace Spaces**, **RunPod** | GPU-backed open environments |
| Full-stack self-hosting | **Railway**, **Fly.io**, or **Render** | Deploy whole stack w/ PostgreSQL + API |
| Edge computing (offline villages) | **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano / MiniPC** | Preload models + data, solar ready |

> Long term: **portable solar-powered BOOM Boxes** with preloaded intelligence per region. Can update via USB or sneakernet.

## 🧠 BOOM AI COMPONENTS LIST

| Component | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 🌱 Tree + Climate Matcher | ✅ Research available, needs fine-tuning | Use FAO EcoCrop or custom DB |
| 🗣️ Natural Language Engine | ✅ Many open models available | Choose based on memory footprint |
| 📍 Geo Intelligence Layer | 🔄 Needs integration | OpenStreetMap, satellite overlays |
| 💚 Karma Credit Engine | 🧪 In design | Needs transparent, meaningful calculation |
| 🎒 BOOM Kit Generator | 🧪 To prototype | Dynamic packing list based on geo/goal |
| 📦 Feedback Engine | 🧪 In vision | Collects real-world impact for stack learning |

---

## 🌐 REPO SETUP (GIT)

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/boom-core` | Main AI intelligence + matching engine |
| `/boom-ui` | Frontend for mobile/web |
| `/boom-node-kit` | Raspberry Pi kit + local deployment scripts |
| `/boom-data` | Structured tree, soil, climate, ecosystem info |
| `/boom-karma` | Karma credit logic + wallet system (initially simple) |

All licensed under **AGPLv3** or **Earth Commons License** — ensuring open use, no private capture, infinite remixing.

## 🌳 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### 1. **Prototype one node**
- One village or permaculture site
- Preloaded on MiniPC or Raspberry Pi with BOOM Stack
- Offline-friendly, solar-powered
- Document EVERYTHING (feedback = learning)

### 2. **Expand across zones**
- Different climate types: tropical, arid, temperate, subtropical
- Kits + stack adapt per zone
- Karma system tested with real-world tasks

### 3. **Open to the world**
- Launch public-facing platform
- Invite contributions to the stack
- Open karma credit API for businesses, institutions

### 🚀 Ready to Plant the First Line of Code?

I can:
- Bootstrap the full folder structure
- Write a `README.md` for contributors
- Set up `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `devconfig`
- Or map out the MVP node test kit blueprint

Where do you want to start digging, Karma? 💚💻
